HOW TO USE THIS APPLICATION 

Find the exe in the root folder of the CD, to be able to connect this to hyperterminal, the CommConfig for both of the applications must match each other.

Make sure the Bits per second, data bits, parity, stop bits, and flow control needs to be set to be exactly the same with this "TerminalEmulator", and the original hyperterminal.

All the source codes are in the "TerminalEmulator" folder, included with the VISUAL STUDIOS PROJECT  file.
